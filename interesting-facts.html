            The <strong>Aurora Borealis</strong>, also known as the Northern Lights, is a natural light display predominantly seen in high-latitude regions around the Arctic. This mesmerizing phenomenon occurs when charged particles from the sun collide with gases in Earth's atmosphere, producing vibrant colors that dance across the night sky.

            The colors of the aurora depend on the type of gas involved and the altitude of the collisions. Green is the most common color, caused by oxygen molecules about 60 miles above the earth. Red, blue, and purple hues can also appear, creating a breathtaking spectacle.
